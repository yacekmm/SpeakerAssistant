# Speaker Assistant

A project that experiments with storing and managing the history of prompts and their corresponding codebase changes.

## Project Structure
- Git repository initialized to track code changes
- Each commit message follows the format:
  ```
  <Summary of changes>
  <Original prompt that led to the changes>
  ```

## Requirements
- Git for version control
- All code changes must be committed with the original prompt that led to the change
- README.md will be kept up to date with new requirements and instructions

## Purpose
This project serves as an experiment to explore whether:
1. Versioning the entire codebase is necessary
2. Storing just the history of prompts is sufficient for project management
3. The relationship between prompts and code changes can be effectively tracked

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Review the commit history to understand how prompts led to specific code changes
3. Follow the commit message format when making new changes
