# Speaker Assistant Development Chat Log

## Initial Setup

I'll help you set up the Speaker Assistant project with Git and implement the prompt-based commit message system. Let me break this down into steps:

1. First, I'll initialize the Git repository and create an initial README.md file.
2. Then I'll make the first commit with your prompt as the commit message.

Let me start by initializing the Git repository:
```bash
git init
```

Now, I'll create a README.md file with the initial project description and requirements.

Now, let's add the README.md to Git and make the initial commit with your prompt as the commit message:
```bash
git add README.md
```

I've set up the initial project structure with the following components:

1. Backend (Python/FastAPI):
   - Audio processing module for real-time analysis
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Device management for audio input/output
   - Integration with StageTimer.io (placeholder)

2. Frontend (React/TypeScript):
   - Modern UI using Material-UI
   - Real-time metrics display
   - Audio device selection
   - Filler word counter with visual indicators
   - Chart for tracking filler words over time
   - Suggested questions display

3. Docker Configuration:
   - Separate containers for frontend and backend
   - Volume mounts for development
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Audio device access configuration

4. Project Structure:
   - Organized directory structure
   - Git configuration
   - Proper .gitignore file

## Hot Reloading Implementation

### Changes Made:
1. Updated frontend Dockerfile:
   - Added `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` for file watching in Docker
   - Added `FAST_REFRESH=true` for React Fast Refresh
   - Configured WebSocket for hot reloading

2. Updated docker-compose.yml:
   - Added environment variables for hot reloading
   - Configured volume mounts for development
   - Ensured proper WebSocket configuration

3. Added comprehensive tests:
   - Component rendering tests
   - WebSocket communication tests
   - Error handling tests
   - Device selection tests

4. Updated documentation:
   - Added development mode section to README.md
   - Documented hot reloading features
   - Updated setup instructions

### Testing Strategy:
- Added unit tests for all major components
- Implemented WebSocket mock for testing
- Added error handling test cases
- Following testing patterns from Tickets repo

### Next Steps:
1. Implement real-time audio processing
2. Set up StageTimer.io integration
3. Add more frontend features
4. Enhance error handling and recovery

Please let me know which direction you'd like to proceed with, and I'll help you implement the next steps.
