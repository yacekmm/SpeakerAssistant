# Speaker Assistant Development Chat Log

## Initial Setup

I'll help you set up the Speaker Assistant project with Git and implement the prompt-based commit message system. Let me break this down into steps:

1. First, I'll initialize the Git repository and create an initial README.md file.
2. Then I'll make the first commit with your prompt as the commit message.

Let me start by initializing the Git repository:
```bash
git init
```

Now, I'll create a README.md file with the initial project description and requirements.

Now, let's add the README.md to Git and make the initial commit with your prompt as the commit message:
```bash
git add README.md
```

I've set up the initial project structure with the following components:

1. Backend (Python/FastAPI):
   - Audio processing module for real-time analysis
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Device management for audio input/output
   - Integration with StageTimer.io (placeholder)

2. Frontend (React/TypeScript):
   - Modern UI using Material-UI
   - Real-time metrics display
   - Audio device selection
   - Filler word counter with visual indicators
   - Chart for tracking filler words over time
   - Suggested questions display

3. Docker Configuration:
   - Separate containers for frontend and backend
   - Volume mounts for development
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Audio device access configuration

4. Project Structure:
   - Organized directory structure
   - Git configuration
   - Proper .gitignore file

The project is now ready for development. Would you like me to:
1. Implement the real-time audio processing functionality?
2. Set up the StageTimer.io integration?
3. Add more features to the frontend?
4. Or focus on a different aspect of the project?

Please let me know which direction you'd like to proceed with, and I'll help you implement the next steps.

## Testing Implementation

Following the testing patterns from the Tickets repository, I've implemented:

1. Backend Tests:
   - Audio processor tests with pytest
   - FastAPI endpoint tests with TestClient
   - WebSocket connection tests
   - Following given/when/then pattern
   - Minimal mocking, focusing on real behavior

2. Frontend Tests:
   - React component tests with Jest and Testing Library
   - Async component testing
   - Mocked API and WebSocket responses
   - UI element presence verification

3. CI Setup:
   - GitHub Actions workflow for both backend and frontend
   - Python and Node.js test environments
   - Coverage reporting with Codecov
   - Automatic test runs on push and PR

4. Test Dependencies:
   - Added pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov
   - Added httpx for FastAPI testing
   - Updated package.json with test scripts

The tests focus on functionality and integration rather than implementation details, avoiding unnecessary mocking and following the patterns from the Tickets repository.
